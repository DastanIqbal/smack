For a given input program, SMACK checks for violations of user-provided\r\nassertions. The tool is open-source and integrates into the well-known LLVM\r\ncompiler infrastructure. Therefore, SMACK can (at least in theory) check any\r\nprogram that can be compiled with LLVM. It should also be relatively easy to\r\nimplement and try out different extensions on top of SMACK.","google":"","tagline":"Static Checker for C/C++ Programs"}
